# Four-Phase-Test
A simple presentation on using the four phase pattern in writing tests for 
code that is subject to mutable state. 

Much like the [diagramming presentation] (https://github.com/andreamazza89/presentations/tree/master/diagramming_presentation),
the focus is on simplifying our lives as develpers, making big tasks easier by 
breaking them down.

Here is a link to the [slideshow] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/jqyg2kcw25qfqf2/four-phase-testing.key?dl=0)

## Practice
Build a tiny traffic system to practice the four-phase-test pattern.

1. Fork this repo
2. Read the [spec] ()
3. Create a new branch, craft some wonderful code, create a pull request so I 
can marvel at it.
