# Diagramming is awesome

A short presentation on the merits of diagramming for a programmer, 
prepared for Makers Academy students, but available to anyone if interested.

The slideshow can be found [here] (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u7tdy4s5prd4l9y/AAC2aH-zJIuVafZ8YBPgYAhta?dl=0).
I am more than happy to discuss or give the presentation, just get in touch.
